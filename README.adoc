[[intro-to-crc]]
== Introduction

This project is focused on bringing a minimal http://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift 4.0 or newer] cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer. 

If you are looking for a solution for running OpenShift 3.x, you will need tools such as `oc cluster up`, http://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/[CDK].

Check back for updates, we plan to have something available "soon".

== Documentation

=== Getting CodeReady Containers

CodeReady Containers binaries with an embedded OpenShift disk image can be downloaded from link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned[this page].

=== Using CodeReady Containers

The documentation for CodeReady Containers is currently hosted by GitHub Pages.

See the link:https://code-ready.github.io/crc/[Red Hat CodeReady Containers Getting Started Guide].

=== Building the documentation

You can find the source files for the documentation in the link:./docs/source[docs/source] directory.

To build the formatted documentation, link:https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/install.md[install podman] then use the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/code-ready/crc
$ cd crc
$ make build_docs
```

This will create a [filename]`docs/build/master.html` file which you can view in your browser.

=== Developing CodeReady Containers

Developers who want to work on CodeReady Containers should visit the link:./developing.adoc[Developing CodeReady Containers] document.

=== Building CodeReady Containers for OKD 4

You can build the crc binaries with OKD 4 embedded images by overriding a couple of environment variables:

You first need to have OKD 4 crcbundle images built from: link:https://github.com/code-ready/snc[https://github.com/code-ready/snc]

```bash
export BUNDLE_VERSION=4.5.0-0.okd-2020-08-12-020541               # The version that you built snc from
export MIRROR=https://github.com/openshift/okd/releases/download
export BUNDLE_DIR=/path/to/your/snc/bundles

make embed_bundle
```
